# NeoVim Config

This repository contains all of my configuration files for adding plugins to customize your neovim to look similar to any other editor on the internet. 

## Install Configurations

Install my-project with npm

```bash 
   bash ~/path/to/your/install.sh   
```
This will install the config files to your home folder.
Then you need to install Neo Vim editor in your terminal.

Install from package
--------------------

Pre-built packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux are found on the
[Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/) page.

[Managed packages] are in [Homebrew], [Debian], [Ubuntu], [Fedora], [Arch Linux], [Void Linux], [Gentoo], and more!

Install from source
-------------------

See the [Building Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim) wiki page for details.

The build is CMake-based, but a Makefile is provided as a convenience.
After installing the dependencies, run the following command.

    make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    sudo make install

To install to a non-default location:

    make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/full/path/
    make install

To inspect the build, these CMake features are useful:

- `cmake --build build --target help` lists all build targets.
- `build/CMakeCache.txt` (or `cmake -LAH build/`) contains the resolved values of all CMake variables.
- `build/compile_commands.json` shows the full compiler invocations for each translation unit.
